      <description>Basic Information The FBI released their annual report on Crime in the U.S. for 2015 last September. It took a little longer than last year for an improved data set (36789) with to appear on the NACJD website.
As I mentioned in a previous post, the main advantage of this data set is that it includes counts of offenses cleared for each reporting agency along with offenses reported.</description>
