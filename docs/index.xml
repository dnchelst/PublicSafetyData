      <title>Census Data All Around Us</title>

      <description>Introduction At first glance, census data should be unrelated to public safety data. At its heart, the US Census Bureau gathers population data.1 However, population data provides important context for understanding other measured quantities. Moreover, it allows comparisons between cities, counties, or states, of varying size.
The Census Bureau recently released a new set of population estimates last month. For many uses, a location’s total population is adequate.</description>

      <description>Basic Information The FBI released their annual report on Crime in the U.S. for 2015 last September. It took a little longer than last year for an improved data set (36789) to appear on the NACJD website.
As I mentioned in a previous post, the main advantage of this data set is that it includes counts of offenses cleared for each reporting agency along with offenses reported.</description>

      <description>Introduction &amp;amp; Critique Atlanta Boston Part II: 911 Calls New Orleans LA &amp;amp; Los Angeles CA (later this month)   Introduction &amp;amp; Critique The Police Data Initiative website contains data supplied by 135 participating agencies as of today’s date. There is likely an agency near you that you might recognize.
In late 2015, the Tucson Police Department’s Lieutenant Myron “Ron” Holubiak brought the Public Safety Open Data Portal to my attention.</description>

      <description>This is a blog about public safety data. The purpose is to highlight some useful online resources that shed light on public safety services.
I&amp;rsquo;ve studied numerous public safety departments since 2008. To me, public safety includes:
- law enforcement agencies (police, sheriff, etc.)
- fire departments,
- and emergency services (aka ambulances).
For some, public safety doesn&amp;rsquo;t include ambulance services, but these are often combined within a fire department.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for citizens to be interested in local crime rates either personally or professionally. Most local law enforcement agencies report monthly crime statistics to city officials and/or residents as well as to a state agency. The state then aggregates the data and forwards it to the FBI as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The FBI annually releases a report on crime. The most recent was called Crime in the United States 2014 which was released on September 28, 2015.</description>

      <title>NFIRS 2014 Available</title>

      <description>Hi everyone.
As a data analyst specializing in public safety for CPSM, I come across National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) data pretty regularly. Usually, I examine a single fire department at a time, but it&amp;rsquo;s also collected nationally by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
After it&amp;rsquo;s collected, a portion of the information is provided to interested researchers for review. You request the data and it arrives via US Mail on a CD.</description>
