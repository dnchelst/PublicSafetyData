      <description>In late 2015, the Tucson Police Department’s Lieutenant Myron “Ron” Holubiak brought the Public Safety Open Data Portal to my attention. The White House’s Police Data Initiative had begun in May 2015 and Tucson PD had announced its participation at the end of October.
In any case, there is now a Police Data Initiative website which lists 135 participating agencies as of today’s date. There is likely an agency that near you that you might recognize.</description>
