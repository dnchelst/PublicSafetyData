      <description>Basic InformationThe FBI released their annual report on Crime in the U.S. for 2015 last September. It took a little longer than last year for an improved data set (36789) with to appear on the NACJD website.
As I mentioned in a previous post, the main advantage of this data set is that it includes counts of offenses cleared for each reporting agency along with offenses reported.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for citizens to be interested in local crime rates either personally or professionally. Most local law enforcement agencies report monthly crime statistics to city officials and/or residents as well as to a state agency. The state then aggregates the data and forwards it to the FBI as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The FBI annually releases a report on crime. The most recent was called Crime in the United States 2014 which was released on September 28, 2015.</description>
