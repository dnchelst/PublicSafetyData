      <description>The Police Data Initiative website contains data supplied by 135 participating agencies as of today’s date. There is likely an agency near you that you might recognize.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for citizens to be interested in local crime rates either personally or professionally. Most local law enforcement agencies report monthly crime statistics to city officials and/or residents as well as to a state agency. The state then aggregates the data and forwards it to the FBI as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The FBI annually releases a report on crime. The most recent was called Crime in the United States 2014 which was released on September 28, 2015.</description>
