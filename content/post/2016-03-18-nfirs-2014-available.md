Hi everyone.

As a data analyst specializing in public safety for CPSM, I come across 
[National Fire Incident Reporting System](https://www.nfirs.fema.gov/) (NFIRS) 
data pretty regularly. 
Usually, I examine a single fire department at a time, 
but it's also collected nationally by the 
[Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/).

After it's collected, a portion of the information is provided to interested 
researchers for review. You 
[request the data](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/statistics/order_download_data.html) 
and it arrives via US Mail on a CD.

I received my copy last week and started looking it over. 
There are no results to share, 
but I started a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dnchelst/NFIRS) and 
placed a copy of the data in an AWS S3 bucket. 
Details at GitHub in the README file.

If NFIRS data interests you, let's start a dialogue! 
If you want to collaborate on GitHub, we can make that happen. 
(I have 2013 and 2011 as well.)

Regards

Dov

P.S. I'm testing the publicly available S3 bucket. 
If it gets too much traffic, I'll need to switch to a BitTorrent protocol.
