The FBI released their 
[annual report](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015) 
on Crime in the U.S. for 2015 
[last September](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2015-crime-statistics).
It took a little longer than last year for an improved 
[data set (36789)](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/36789?searchSource=revise&q=36789) 
with to appear on the 
[NACJD website](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/index.jsp). 

As I mentioned in a previous post, the main advantage of this data set is that 
it includes counts of _offenses cleared_ for each reporting agency along with
_offenses reported_. If you would like to have a conversation, 
there are reasons why this information may be inaccurate for most agencies in
Washington state.

on murder clearance rates in Cleveland with embedded video interviews. It also
includes comparisons with other cities of similar size such as New Orleans.
